Missing values:
breakfast - 8, 9
lunch - 15, 4
b + l - 32, 3
sussy - 42, 10


TODO:
1. Put all preprocessing data in a function so that it can be reused for test data
2. Do I need to pad or extend the cgm times also? How to use time-series data?
3. why are we putting lunch calories in training dataset? rhea?
4. What if the person did not eat breakfast/lunch? Consider later: use the two hour check
5. Darsh work on PPT and Report


Dish steps:
-- Viome preprocessing
-- merge training datasets (IMG --> CMG --> LABEL --> VIOME)
-- image preprocessing
-- cgm preprocessing: time series data to min max and mean representation???
-- encode race column
-- scale all columns in merged df
